## 🧠 Vision

This project envisions a fully autonomous AI content creator that learns and adapts to trends, audience preferences, and creative storytelling. From one input ("Make something travel-themed"), it will soon generate reels, captions, and schedule posts intelligently.


## 📌 Tech Stack

- Python + OpenCV + ffmpeg
- Instagram Graph API / Appium
- CLIP, AVA aesthetic model, LAION aesthetic predictor
- LangChain + CrewAI (future)
- Jupyter for rapid prototyping

## 🚀 Current Capabilities

✅ **Automated Audio Downloader**  
- Pulls trendy and high-engagement audio from Instagram

✅ **Aesthetic Image Selector**  
- Uses a combination of CLIP, AVA and LAION-Aesthetic models  
- Filters based on relevance sharpness, noise, exposure, and aesthetic score  
- Selects the best sequence of images for visual storytelling

✅ **AI-powered Reel Creator**  
- Generates visually stunning, clean reels with cinematic transitions  
- Syncs image sequences to selected audio intelligently

✅ **Instagram Auto-Uploader**  
- Automatically posts the reel with a GenAI-generated caption and hashtags  
- Integrates with Instagram's API or automation layer

## 🔮 Future Scope

🧠 **Agentic Loop for Content Evolution**  
- Integrate feedback loops using likes, reach, shares, and comments  
- Continuously evolve content strategy through self-optimization

📈 **Trend-Tracking Engine**  
- Monitor Instagram and TikTok trends using LLMs & scraping agents  
- Forecast rising audio trends and content formats

🪄 **Prompt-to-Reel Pipeline**  
- User inputs a theme or vibe → System generates full video  
- Will include image generation and narrative syncing

🕸️ **Multi-Platform Syndication**  
- Extend automation to YouTube Shorts, Pinterest, and TikTok

🧩 **Fully Modular Agent Architecture**  
- Plug-and-play agents for planning, scheduling, generation, feedback, and replanning  
- Inter-agent communication using CrewAI or similar frameworks
